    The platform independent Unity3d installation path. This path will be suffixed by "Editor/Unity.exe" on Windows and
    "Contents/MacOS/Unity" on Mac by the plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
    This field is <em>optional</em> on the jenkins master if you do not intend to build with unity3d on the master.
    Do not forget to configure the location of the installations on your nodes as needed.
    </p>

    <p>You may use environment variables in the path and define those variables wherever you feel like (master, node, job). The final installation path will be resolved at job execution time.</p>
